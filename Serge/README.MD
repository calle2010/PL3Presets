A set of strong presets for B&W conversion of landscape shots.

Includes graduated filters to darken the upper and lower part of the picture. 
The five control points add exposure (+0.50) to lighten up parts of the middle
ground. These are supposed to be moved around to points where attention should be 
drawn to or just to add some contrast to a dull part of the picture.

- Preset Type: Partial

  - DxO PhotoLab 3
  - FilmPack 5 Essential

- Included Tools:
  - Tone curve
  - HSL for B&W conversion and darkening blue (e. g. sky)

  - Local Adjustments
